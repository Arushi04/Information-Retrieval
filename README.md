### Information-Retrieval

Projects are done in the order:

1. **elastic_search** : Here we have explored elastic search. We clean the dataset which consists of around 85000 documents and their text and index it on the elastic search.

2. **ranking_using_models** : We will be ranking the documents indexed in elastic search using multiple vector and language models and see which model performs the best.

3. **self_indexing** : Here, we have created our own index(similar to what elastic search does), index the data and see how the models rank those indexed data and how close we are in performance if compared to that of elastic search.

4. **web_crawling** : Wrote a web crawler which takes few seed urls as input and do the crawling of the most relevant pages with politeness.
